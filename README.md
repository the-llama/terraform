Noodling with Terraform

Esoterics:
Essentially trying to build two virtual private clouds and have two way communication between the two. I have assumed use of 80/443 for the web app itself, and have built security rules as such.
Would have liked to have located the VPC in separate cloud locations, but I wasn't able to find how to accomplish that as of yet.

--ToDo: 
1. security rules
2. configure infrastructure inside each cloud
5. (Three, sir!) Find how to geo-locate to separate cloud
4. See if this actually works....
